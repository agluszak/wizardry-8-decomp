/* Engine Code\GrCycle.cpp. BEHAVIOUR_FIRST and BEHAVIOUR_LAST come from the
   canonical assertion at line 1598; the body bounds-checks against 1 and 3, so
   the enum runs 1..3. The stored-to object is whatever GrCycle's primary vtable
   slot 9 returns; only the byte it writes at +0x70 is established here.
   Slots 0..8 are declared solely to place slot 9 at vtable offset 0x24, which
   is what the canonical virtual call uses. */
